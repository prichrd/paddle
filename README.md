# Paddle

Paddle is a simple pong implementation in Rust using SDL2. It allows two players to play together
using the `W`/`S` keys and `Up`/`Down` keys. Each time a player scores, their score increments,
and because Paddle is so much fun, you get to play forever!

## Run It!

- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation).
- Run `cargo run` from the root of the project.
